          <p>4.PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values

             and 
            Y
             and asks you to find the relation between them.
            The relationships between integers 
            X
             and 
            Y
             are as follows:

            X
            <
            Y
            , it means that 
            X
             is smaller than 
            Y
            .
            If 
            X
            >
            Y
            , it means that 
            X
             is greater than 
            Y
            .
            If 
            X
            =
            Y
            , it means that 
            X
             is equal to 
            Y
